<h1>How Josef muller brockmann influenced minimalism and modernism as we know it today?</h1>
</header>

<h2>With minimalism beginning through the impact of 1950’s swiss design, did Josef muller brockmann shape the path of the movement thus influencing the modernist designs we see today?</h2>

<p>Brockmann is a popular name when it comes to swiss design.  He is said to be the founder of the movement and was a great influence on many in the 1950’s.  Throughout his career in graphic design he has had the opportunity to work in many areas.  He was appointed as director of the departments of graphic design at Zurich school of arts and crafts but retired in 1960 and worked with young graphic artists such as Carlo Vivarelli in which they worked together through typography on an exhibition project, thus giving Brockamnn typography experience by designing concert posters for Zurich town hall.</p>

<p>He was highly regarded for his posters, which use text, photographs and simple graphics to create striking and rhythmic compositions. The grid format he created which enabled designs to be constructive is what he is best known for.</p>

<blockquote>“In my designs for posters, advertisements, brochures and exhibitions, subjectivity is suppressed in favour of a geometric grid that determines the arrangement of the type and images. The grid is an organisational system that makes it easier to read the message. The grid is an organisational system that enables you to achieve an orderly result at a minimum cost. The task is solved more easily, faster and better.”</blockquote><cite>- Josef Muller Brockmann</cite>

<h3>BUT what is swiss design?</h3>
<p>Swiss designs used crisp, blocky, asymmetric layouts with text aligned to the left.  The typefaces used in the designs were sans serif typefaces like Akzidenz Grotesk and, later, Helvetica.  All traces of the designer’s concept should be minimalised in order to let the “content” of work be the main focus, therefore enforcing a minimalist design ethos.</p>

<h3>Minimalism</h3>
<p>Minimalism is something Brockmann loved, when asked, “What do you regard as your best work?” He responded, “The white reverse sides of my posters!”.  He consistently pursued the reduction and decline of statements until he has an objective message.  His demand for unbiased practical and objective design is what became swiss graphic design.</p>

<p>His work was aimed at revealing a key visual message.  To do this, he examined multiple elements in the design process,  minimalizing each one to their essential nature.
He strove to form a deeper awareness of how his work was composed by formal planes and volumes and ordered through the use of space and colour.</p>

<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Today we see simplicity and clarity of use everywhere, even through our websites.  Brockamnn never used decorative elements in his work because he wanted to get to the main objective, which is what many people want today when on an app or viewing a website, they want it to be easy and simple to use.  Therefore, brockmanns minimalistic work can have an influence on many designers due to its clear message aimed at an audience.  I definitely believe that if it wasn’t for the movement of swiss design that brockmann is known for beginning then the clarity of posters as an example wouldn’t be as objective as they are today.</p>
