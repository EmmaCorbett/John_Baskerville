 <h2> Creating a brand that reflects me </h2>

 <h3>  Through this project I created a monogram, a wordmark, a visual marque and a set of brand guidelines.</h3>
<h3> Skills:</h3>

 <h4> Always start on Paper <h4>

   <p> To begin I sketched out ideas of what what I wanted my monogram to look like.  I had multiple approaches to this ranging from an industrial style to a more feminine and elegant style.</p>

  <h5> Digitalising</h5>

  <p> I choose two monogram ideas and digitalised them, however I decided to go for the more curvy and elegant looking one as I think this is more delicate and femnine looking, like me.  I then added colour to my monogram.  I decided to choose the colours gold and silver with a gradient, so my monogram looks like a ribbon overlapping.  </p>

  <p>  I then wanted to choose a wordmark that looked good beside my monogram.  I wanted a simplistic wordmark because I knew a hand written font would clash with my monogram.  After sketching out fonts and realising they looked too decorative I went to google fonts to find more simplistic ones.  I then decided to use the font, 'Source Sans Pro'.  This is a minimalistoc and simple font.  I made some alterations to the two t's as i wanted them to look like two corsses and I added an illustration between two m's</.p>

<p> I found coming up with a visual marque very difficult.  So I used a wordmap I created at the start of the project to reflect on what my likes and dislikes are.  Illustrating is a strength of mine and something I enjoy. Therefore, I sketched out some ideas and digitalised them.  At fist I didn't include my monogram in my visual marque, but I thought it would be a nice touch.  As you can see elements of my visual marque are on my wordmark.<p>

<h5> Bringing it all together </h5>
<p> Now that I've created a monogram, a wordmark and a visual marque, I have put them all togetehr to create a set of brand guidelines and a website.  You can view them below. </p>
